## üßæ Key SQL Queries Used

Here are examples of KPIs and trend queries used in MySQL:

### üìå KPIs

```sql
-- Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;
-- Average Order Value
SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Average_Order_Value FROM pizza_sales;
-- Total Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales;

üßæ Key SQL Queries Used
-- Daily Order Trend
SELECT DAYNAME(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%d-%m-%Y')) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY order_day
ORDER BY FIELD(order_day, 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday');

-- Monthly Trend
SELECT MONTHNAME(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%d-%m-%Y')) AS Month_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY Month_Name;

ü•á Top Performers
-- Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Bottom 5 by Quantity
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold ASC
LIMIT 5;
